 * The representation of all possible *left-pointing* diagonals in a board. A diagonal is identified by two edge
 * squares and defines all the squares of the same color in between, the two edge squares included. A
 * *left-pointing* diagonal is tilted to the left, that is, the file of the edge square on the greater rank is
 * lower or equal than the file of the other edge square.
 *

 * Note that corners `A1` and `H8` are special cases of diagonals of length 1.
